# HVAC-ground-truth-model

This is a Matlab implementation of the ground-truth dynamics used to study digital implementation effects in energy management.

The ground-truth dynamics is designed in Matlab including the building envelope, room temperature and HVAC components. The continuous-time dynamics are implemented as an ODE function. The code has been tested in Matlab R2022b. Compatibility with other Matlab versions is not guaranteed.
